Tabluar data is most commonly provided to researchers in a simple spreadsheet format known as csv, which stands for *comma separated values*. Because of this, pandas has a function to load tabular data from a csv file:  `read_csv`. The most basic way to use the `read_csv` function is to simply give it the path to the csv file you want to load. Here, we will load the example survey data, which is contained in the file \"survey_responses.csv\" in our GitHub repo:"

    "Notice that the top row and the leftmost column are special. The top row is bolded and contains text that looks different from the rest of the table; this is because it is the *header* of the DataFrame. The header does not contain real data; instead, it contains the names of each column. Meanwhile, the leftmost column does not have a name and simply contains consecutive numbers [0,1,2,3,4,...]. This is the *index* of the DataFrame; by default this works likes row numbers in an Excel file, but more generally you can think of the index as containing the name of each row. This index is also similar to the primary key of a sql table with the exception that an index is allowed to have duplicates.\n",

    "- Treat the first row of the CSV file as the header\n",
    "- Create an index from scratch containing consecutive numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "But this behavior is customizable via parameters in `read_csv`, and you may need to customize it depending on what your CSV file looks like. In this case, you might have noticed that the file already contains a column that looks like an index (\"Response_ID\"), which means that pandas' automatically-generated index is redundant. Therefore, we might want to tell pandas to use the \"Response_ID\" column as the index. We can do this using the `index_col` parameter of `read_csv`:"

NaN is short for \"Not A Number\" and is pandas' way of representing *missing data*. Think of NaNs as equivalent to an empty cell in an Excel file. The meaning of missing data depends on the context of the dataset. In this case, since this data is from a survey and each column represents a survey question, we can infer that in this case missing data means that the survey taker did not give an answer for that question. In research, we often want to do something special to handle missing data; we will return to this later in the workshop."

    "## 8. Modifying and adding rows\n",
    "Queries aren't just useful for accessing data; we may sometimes also want to *modify* data that matches a query! One common reason to do this is for data preprocessing. Let's consider an example that's quite common in survey work. The \"Self_Confidence\" column contains answers to a multiple-choice question meant to represent a scale of *intensity*, with seven options representing increasing levels of confidence: \"Disagree strongly\", \"Disagree somewhat\", \"Disagree slightly\", \"Don't know / not applicable\", \"Agree slightly\", \"Agree somewhat\", and \"Agree strongly\". We might wish to turn this into a numerical Likert Scale, with values from 0 to 6 where 0 is \"Disagree strongly\" and 6 is \"Agree strongly\". This is commonly done in social science research to enable more quantitative comparisons of responses on scale-based questions like this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider one step in this Likert scale conversion, changing \"Disagree strongly\" to 0. We can achieve this with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a query to find all instances of the thing you want to preprocess (in this case, rows where the Self_Confidence is \"Disagree strongly\") (See Section 7)\n",
    "2. Use row-and-column indexing to combine this query (which selects certain rows) with column selection (See Section 5)\n",
    "3. Use Python assigment syntax (the \"=\" operator) to set the new value (in this case, 0)\n",
    "\n",

    "In this example, we *replaced* values in an existing column. But there are other cases where instead, you might want to preserve the original data, and instead put the cleaned data in a new column. pandas lets us do this too! As an example, let's consider the \"Moving_Times\" column. The data in this column counts how many times the survey participant has moved prior to taking the survey. You may imagine that for some research questions we don't necessarily care about the exact number of moving times, but instead only need to know whether the survey participant has moved at all (a boolean value). But this does not mean we want to completely replace the \"Moving_Times\" column, because for *other* research questions we might actually care about the exact number of moving times! So instead, we might want to create a *new* column that contains the simplified information of whether or not a survey participant has moved.\n",

    "In section 6, we showed how to summarize data from an *entire* column, such as taking the min and max of numerical data. This is useful for initial exploration, but when tackling actual research questions, we often want to do more complicated operations involving interactions between multiple variables. For example, instead of just finding the earliest year in the data, we might be interested in finding the earliest year each tag first appeared. Using what we have learned so far, one way to do this would be to use queries: for each tag, you could write a query to select only the rows containing that tag, and call the `min` method each time. But this is extremely tedious, given that there are so many tags in the data! Thankfully, pandas offers a faster alternative: `groupby`.\n",

For example, if we use `groupby` on the \"tag\" column, we'll have one group containing rows tagged \".htaccess\", another containing rows tagged \"python\", and so on, for every unique tag. Now, if we just run `groupby` on its own, we won't immediately see anything useful:"
